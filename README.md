## Automated Attendance Tracking

A Python program designed to help teachers streamline attendance. The students' names and ID number are stored in a dictionary. It will then ask to scan an Id or to type 'q' or 'Q' to quit the program. After an Id is scanned, it will print out the day, the date, and the time it was scanned at. The program will be able to print out the day, the date, and the time using strftime. If all the students are done scanning the Id's the teacher can either type 'q' or 'Q' and it will end the program and not ask to scan an Id anymore. It will also tell who is late or absent and store that data somewhere else.
